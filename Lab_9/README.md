>> Fixing Issues:
- It was recently discovered that I had overwritten the entire Path environment variable some time in the past few years. This has caused numerous issues with other softwares, and was only fixed 1-2 weeks ago. After adding Python paths to the variable, Python could be run using Windows. The rest of this lab was completed using [**Windows PowerShell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) run as an administrator.

>> [**YANG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YANG):

Made it to the "pyang" command step.

Result of running "pyang -f yin -o intrusiondetection.yin intrusiondetection.yang" on the Powershell terminal.

Unfortunately, I could not progress the lab any further using Windows Powershell. Hence, I moved to Raspberry Pi.
