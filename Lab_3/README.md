>> Lesson 3 Studying:

- I attempted to install python3 to Ubuntu. I failed.
- In more detail, a group of fellow students and I attempted to install python3 to Ubuntu. Unfortunately, no matter which method we tried, it failed to download. We attempted to look up solutions on numerous websites, attempted to fix numerous systems (including altering network settings, DNS, firewall / security, baseline ubuntu / WSL settings, updates, etc), and overall gave it our 100% effort to fix this issue. However, it nonetheless failed. The current plan is to further inspect the issue with IT. If this does not work, a more convoluted method of completing the lab may be necessary.
