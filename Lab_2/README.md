>> Initial Attempt:

- IoT Lessons 1 and 2 were studied, and the Lab itself was completed up to the "man" command. This was done using Windows Powershell, so this command could not run properly. I proceeded to uninstall and reinstall Ubuntu, but due to forgetting to commit changes to this README before restarting, the file was lost.

>> Ubuntu (re)Installation:

- WSL was reinstalled, using the Ubuntu Linux distribution.
