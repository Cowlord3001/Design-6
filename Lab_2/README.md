>> Initial Attempt:

- IoT Lessons 1 and 2 were studied, and the Lab itself was completed up to the "man" command. This was done using Windows Powershell, so this command could not run properly. I proceeded to uninstall and reinstall Ubuntu, but due to forgetting to commit changes to this README before restarting, the file was lost.

>> Ubuntu (re)Installation:

- WSL was reinstalled, using the Ubuntu Linux distribution. After peer review, debugging, and research, it was successfully installed.

>> Lab Continuation:

- With Ubuntu now installed, the lab was continued. Unfortunately, the iot file needed to be copied into Ubuntu, resulting in an estimated 6.5 hour download. I instead attempted to clone the repository to Ubuntu, but this timed out.
