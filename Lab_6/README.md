>> Installing [**Node.js**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js):

- Installation was successful, except for an error upgrading Python3. This was disregarded, assuming it would not affect the lab itself.
  - This was a terrible decision that came back to haunt me later.
- Installation took the entirety of the class demonstration to complete.

>> Lab A6: Node.js:

- Cloned into iot GitHub repository, continuing the lab from here.

>> Lab B6: 

- Error. The pip3 term was not recognized, nor was pip in general. This is likely due to the original error duing the Node.js installation.
- The rest of this lab was saved for Raspberry Pi.

>> Lab B6 (Attempt #2):

- The errors in this lab stemmed from the same issues as Lab 3. Since this was resolved by using a Raspberry Pi via [**VNC Viewer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealVNC), the remainder of this lab will be completed in a similar fashion.
