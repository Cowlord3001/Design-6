>> Errors & observations encountered while installing GHDL and GTKWave:

- After advisement from a peer, downloaded Ubuntu to install the programs through WSL.
- Download process was smooth, except for the process of deciding a username. This was attempted multiple times, culminating in the simple username of "chris" after
  Ubuntu refused the other choices. Further investigation is required to determine why this occured, although it is likely that certain characters are blacklisted
  from the WSL username.
- Download for GHDL / GTKWave failed using Linux download instructions.
