>> Errors & observations encountered while installing GHDL and GTKWave:

- After advisement from a peer, downloaded Ubuntu to install the programs through WSL.
- Download process was smooth, except for the process of deciding a username. This was attempted multiple times, culminating in the simple username of "chris" after
  Ubuntu refused the other choices. Further investigation is required to determine why this occured, although it is likely that certain characters are blacklisted
  from the WSL username.
- Download for GHDL / GTKWave failed using Linux download instructions.

>> Installation through Windows:

- After numerous issues during installation attempts through Windows / Ubuntu, decided to instead install GHDL and GTKWave through Windows.
- Instructions followed in the GHDL GitHub, downloading and extracting the files before moving their subfolders to the new "eda" folder.
- Environmental variables were added (note: I have had issues with environmental variables in the past, so this should be the first place to debug if issues arise).
- The command "$ cp ~/dsd/ghdl/*vhdl ." failed on the Command Prompt, creating another roadblock. ***This was solved by using Windows PowerShell.
- The ghdl commands failed on Windows PowerShell.
