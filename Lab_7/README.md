>> Lab 7B: Google Sheets:

I attempted to navigate [**IAM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) using Raspberry Pi, but this led to extreme delay and made the process quite uncomfortable. I instead used my laptop to navigate IAM, completing the lab with the help of a colleague. This program was run for a few hours to collect data.
